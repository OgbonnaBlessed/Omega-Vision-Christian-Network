        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>
            Our vision is to be a beacon of God's light, transforming lives through the power of the Holy Spirit and the unchanging Word of God. We aspire to create an environment where individuals can encounter God intimately, experience His love profoundly, and be equipped to live victoriously in Christ.

            "You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden." (Matthew 5:14)
        </p>

        <p>
            We envision a church where every believer is empowered to walk in their God-given purpose, contributing to the advancement of God's Kingdom on earth. As we grow in faith and unity, we strive to impact our community and beyond, demonstrating the love of Christ through acts of service and compassion.

            "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." (Ephesians 2:10)
        </p>

        <h1 class="same-title">Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            Our mission is to glorify God by making disciples of all nations, rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Spirit. We are committed to:
        </p>
            
        <p>
            1. Proclaiming the Gospel:
            Preaching the good news of Jesus Christ with boldness and clarity, reaching out to the lost and the brokenhearted. 
            
            "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation." (Mark 16:15)
        </p>

        <p>
            2. Fostering Spiritual Growth:
            Encouraging and nurturing the spiritual growth of our members through in-depth Bible study, fervent prayer, and heartfelt worship.
            
            "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." (2 Peter 3:18)
        </p>

        <p>
            3. Building a Community of Believers:
            Creating a supportive and loving community where believers can fellowship, share their faith, and support one another in their spiritual journeys.
            
            "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer." (Acts 2:42)
        </p>

        <p>
            4. Empowering for Service:
            Equipping believers to serve God and others with their unique gifts and talents, fostering a culture of servanthood and generosity.
            
            "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms." (1 Peter 4:10)
        </p>

        <p>
            5. Impacting the Community:
            Demonstrating the love of Christ through practical acts of kindness, community outreach, and social justice initiatives, reflecting God's heart for the needy and the oppressed.
            
            "Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." (Matthew 5:16)
        </p>

        <p>
            Our mission is grounded in the belief that every life can be transformed by the power of the Gospel. As we commit to these principles, we trust in God's promise to guide and strengthen us, enabling us to fulfill His divine purpose.

            "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." (Romans 8:28)
        </p>
