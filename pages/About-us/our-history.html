        <h1>Our History</h1>

        <p>
            In 2010, driven by a deep desire to encounter the realities of the Spirit, Apostle Clement Gabriel, then a dedicated member of the Mountain of Fire Ministry (MFM), embarked on a journey that would forever transform lives. The foundation of our ministry was laid in fervent prayer, as Apostle Clement, inspired by Jeremiah 33:3, called upon God for guidance and power: "Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know."
        </p>

        <p>
            What began as a small gathering soon blossomed into a powerful movement. Weeks of intense prayer turned into months, and testimonies of healing and deliverance began to flow abundantly. The presence of God was unmistakable, drawing more people to our meetings and stirring a holy commotion within the church. This growth led to a pivotal moment when Apostle Clement was summoned by Dr. Dike Olukoya, the General Overseer of MFM. Instead of facing criticism, Apostle Clement received a blessing and anointing to continue his divine mission, echoing the words of Isaiah 61:1, "The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor."
        </p>

        <p>
            Our journey took us to a humble place known as Lastma Yard. Despite the challenges posed by rain and disruptions from LASTMA authorities, we held steadfast, trusting in God's provision as promised in Philippians 4:19, "And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus." By His grace, we moved to a more stable location beside the Total filling station in Pencinema.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hand of the Lord continued to manifest mightily among us. Healings and miracles became a regular occurrence, not just within our congregation but also among those from nearby churches. This divine favor, however, did not come without its trials, as we faced persecution from some quarters. Yet, we remained unshaken, holding onto the promise in Romans 8:31, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2017, with unwavering faith in God's direction, we transitioned to a venue at Abundant Life Church. The rent was five times higher than our previous place, yet we believed firmly in Proverbs 3:5-6, "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." Our commitment to prayer, worship, and the Word grew stronger, leading many to salvation and deeper knowledge of God.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a year and a half, in 2019, we moved to our current location, a testament to God's unending faithfulness. Here, we continue to uphold the divine mandate given to Apostle Clement: to build an atmosphere saturated with God's presence, where prayer, worship, and the Word are paramount. We are not just a church; we are a body helped by God, standing firm on the truth of 1 Corinthians 3:11, "For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."
        </p>

        <p>
            As we look back on our journey, we see a tapestry woven with the threads of God's grace, power, and provision. We invite you to join us as we continue to seek His face, uproot the foundations of the wicked, and build systems of the Kingdom. To God be the glory for the great things He has done and will continue to do through this ministry.
        </p>
