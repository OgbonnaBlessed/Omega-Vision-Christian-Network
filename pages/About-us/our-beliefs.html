        <h1>Our Beliefs</h1>

        <p>
            As a body of believers, we are committed to living out the principles of God's Word and fostering a deep, personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Our beliefs are grounded in Scripture and guide our faith, worship, and daily lives. Below is a summary of the core beliefs that define our church community:
        </p>

        <p>
            1. The Trinity:
               We believe in one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
               "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)
        </p>

        <p>
            2. The Bible:
               We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God.
               "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness." (2 Timothy 3:16)
        </p>

        <p>
            3. Salvation:
               We believe that salvation is a gift from God, received through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.
               "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithâ€”and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God." (Ephesians 2:8)
        </p>

        <p>
            4. Jesus Christ:
               We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His atoning death through His shed blood, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.
               "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." (Hebrews 13:8)
        </p>

        <p>
            5. The Holy Spirit:
               We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.
               "But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you." (John 14:26)
        </p>

        <p>
            6. The Church:
               We believe in the universal Church, the body of Christ, consisting of all believers, and in the local church as a visible expression of the body of Christ.
               "Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it." (1 Corinthians 12:27)
        </p>

        <p>
            7. Baptism and Communion:
               We believe in water baptism by immersion as an outward sign of an inward change, and in the regular observance of the Lord's Supper as a remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.
               "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew 28:19)
               "Do this in remembrance of me." (1 Corinthians 11:24)
        </p>

        <p>
            8. Sanctification:
               We believe in sanctification through the Word of God and by the Holy Spirit, and in personal holiness, purity of heart, and life.
               "Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth." (John 17:17)
        </p>

        <p>
            9. Eternal Life:
               We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost: the saved to eternal life and the lost to eternal damnation.
               "And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." (Matthew 25:46)
        </p>

        <p>
            10. Spiritual Gifts:
                We believe in the operation of the gifts of the Spirit as enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12-14 and that they are available to believers today.
                "Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good." (1 Corinthians 12:7)
        </p>

        <p>
            11. Marriage and Family:
                We believe that marriage is a covenant relationship between one man and one woman, designed by God to be a lifelong union.
                "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
        </p>

        <p>
            12. The Second Coming:
                We believe in the personal, visible, and imminent return of Jesus Christ to establish His kingdom on earth.
                "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first." (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
        </p>

        <p>
            13. Fasting and Prayer:
                We believe in the power of fasting and prayer as essential practices for spiritual growth, guidance, and breakthrough. Through fasting, we humble ourselves before God, seeking His face and aligning our hearts with His will. Through prayer, we communicate with God, interceding for others and receiving His direction and strength.
                *"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly." (Matthew 6:17-18)
                "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." (James 5:16)
